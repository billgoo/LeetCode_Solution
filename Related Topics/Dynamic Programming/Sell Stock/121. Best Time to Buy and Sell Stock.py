# Testcase Example:  '[7,1,5,3,6,4]'
#
# You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock
# on the i^th day.
# 
# You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock
# and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
# 
# Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you
# cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit =
# 6-1 = 5.
# Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you
# must buy before you sell.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit =
# 0.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= prices.length <= 10^5
# 0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4
# 
#

    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # # standard with dp table
        # n = len(prices)
        # # init
        # dp = [[0 for _ in range(2)] for j in range(n)]
        # for i in range(n):
        #     dp[i][1] = float('-inf')
        # dp[0][1] = -prices[0]
        # # dp loop
        # for i in range(1, n):
        #     dp[i][0] = max(dp[i - 1][0], dp[i - 1][1] + prices[i])
        #     dp[i][1] = max(dp[i - 1][1], -prices[i])

        # return dp[n - 1][0]

        # simplify solution
        n = len(prices)
        dp_i_0, dp_i_1 = 0, -prices[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp_i_0 = max(dp_i_0, dp_i_1 + prices[i])
            dp_i_1 = max(dp_i_1, -prices[i])
        return dp_i_0
